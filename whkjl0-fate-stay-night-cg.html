                            <p> Care to share your favorite CG picture in the VN? It can also be from Fate/Hollow Ataraxia. Got this idea while commenting on an r/otomegames post, figured I'd open it to any visual novels. It's been a while since there's been a thread like this (assuming Reddit search hasn't lied to me). My favorite CG is from Okita's route in Hakuoki (https://pixelheals.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/pac-man-screen-shot-62914-5-44-pm-3.png) (spoiler), where (#s "fury!Okita and fury!Chizuru drink each other's blood"). Most of the routes feature CGs where general Hakuoki spoilers (#s "the love inter.

Infinite stratos made me wonder how deep the rabbit Well, after having the inner-debate with myself of weather I should or should not actually post these, I decided there might be people who want them and didn't notice the post on /r/typemoon or just don't go there Fate: Unlimited Blade Works: https://www.mediafire.com/?jtelwt1rrmv9n74 Heaven's Feel: Fate/Hollow Ataraxia: http://www.mediafire.com/downl. 
So I was able to figure out how to extract the CGs and thought I should upload them for those who wanted them but had been unable to get them. Fate: Unlimited Blade Works: https://www.mediafire.com/?jtelwt1rrmv9n74 Heaven's Feel: Fate/Hollow Ataraxia: Also if this isn't allowed. Hai :3 So I just finished F/SN a short while ago, was incredible (still haven't decided if I prefer it over Tsukihime or not, and will possibly never be able to make that decision, honestly xD). Anyway, I have a bunch of CGs that weren't unlocked despite me having gone through all the endings. I was hoping you could help me with this. I played the game uncensored, if that matters. I have everything unlocked in Fate, but I'm missing a bunch # Disclaimers Before getting into the writeup, I’d like to clarify its purpose. I’m not out to convert everyone into Angieism, or accuse people who don’t like her of bad taste. If you find her annoying, there is little I can do. If you prefer characters who are more morally white, or who are net positive influence for the group, that’s your prerogative. If you think the way her character treats other cultures/religion/sex is insensitive, I’d actually agree to an extent, though it’s not enough. Go to previous first post (https://redd.it/bgdfpg) of FGO/Trivia Takeuchi Takashi, the co-founder of TYPE-MOON. ---- ---- #Non-TYPE MOON copyright works, are done by Takeuchi.

So it's not so much a massive horror story like you have with people like Bruce. I've gotten lucky and unlucky, the group I used to DnD with was my brother and his friends. they didn't mind me tagging in and having a round or two of games. For the most part things were fine, a few issues here and there but nothing too major.of course, this is before she arrived.

Real name : Takeuchi Tomotaka (竹内友崇). Birth date : 28 August 1973.

Takeuchi’s role in TYPE-MOON : Co-founder of home company, character designer, character design director, supervisor, storyboard, graphic artist, backgr. It all began with banking business. For three and a half years I was working in a company which was responsible for payment terminals. The fate decided that I was one of three people with a proper knowledge and skill to independently work night shifts (between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.). I was responsible for taking care of printouts from terminals and cases of lost or stolen credit cards. Sounds pretty boring, doesn’t it? It is really boring and really exhausting. At some point (winter season) It's finally here after many years of waiting. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7RIMd44Rus (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7RIMd44Rus) amp#x200B; UPDATE 3/19/19The first update to the patch has been released.

There is a unique sense of genuineness, originality and unbridled honesty that Nas captures on this project – “My approach was to talk about that kid on the corner… that kid wasn’t on stage, I wanted the stage to come to him on the block” (https://youtu.be/L_4tAafaUfs?t=616) and that’s exactly what he was able to achieve – it was just a young kid given the rare opportunity. I'm a big fan of visual novels of all kinds. Played Katawa Shoujo back in the day. Fate Stay Night. And a few other. A few months ago I discovered this amazing game called Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc and was hooked for weeks. I just recently finished playing it a second time and will start the second one soon. But! After replaying it, i was filled with the desire for a more Romance focused VN with a similar play style of Danganronpa. What i mean is, something that's different There's been a fair bit of talk about Ilya's route in this subreddit lately thanks to some posts, as well as the Heaven's Feel movies, specifically part 2. I've definitely contributed to this, but there was some conversation about what her route would've been recently on a piece of fanart I posted, and some folks are questioning what Nasu intended and even if she was really going to be a possible romance option, which admittedly wasn't intended with that post. So, I'm going to answer 
So I’ve just finished episode 4/8 of Umineko and I absolutely love it. If I compare it to say Steins Gate (which don’t get me wrong is a great VN), then Steins Gate feels incredibly dragged out with unnecessary idle chatter. While with Umineko, when shit hits the fan, then it continues to hit the fan for a long while. Making it incredibly well paced and manages to maintain interest. I want to know what to read next. I have binged Umineko for about a week straight, so I might pause p : https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/9ah2ve/oc_the_hel_jumper_chapter_72/ f : https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/7oulr8/oc_the_hel_jumper_chapter_1/ w : https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/authors/sabatonbabylon y : https://www.paypal.me/SBHJ L1 : https://imgur.com/a/kDf1ItH#p6v0qgr L2 : https://imgur.com/a/cgVkwxX s : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwED4C5FJuo n : https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/9cefm6/oc_the_hel_jumper_chapter_74/ Previous p First MATCH RESULTS Winner Match Finish Loser Stipulation --- --- ---- ---- Nia Jax and Ember Moon Eclipse Alexa Bliss and Mickie James No Way Jose Wind Up Knock-Out Punch John Skyler The Revival Shatter Machine Anderson and Gallows 1st round of tag team tournament Mandy Rose w/ Paige and Sonya DeVille Knee to the Head Sasha Banks w/ Bayley The Authors of Pain w/ Paul Ellering The Last Chapter Slater and Rhyno Matt Hardy and Bray Wyatt Sister. It’s your first week on r/anime. You’re happy. You’re excited. You recently started watching anime, and you’re proud to say that you just finished Cowboy Bebop and Madoka Magica, the two “most important-est smart perfect anime ever,” according to your otaku friend. And here you are, looking for some new recommendations, some friends (maybe, but are those even real?), and of course, the discussions. But browsing through comment sections for anime announcements and complaint threads, you start.
