Pianoteq is an award-winning virtual instrument which you can install on your computer (PC/Mac). It can be used both in standalone mode and as an instrument plug-in in VST, AAX, and AudioUnits hosts.  · Забегая немного вперед могу сказать, что моя “цифра” звучит лучше, чем многие “деревянные” фортепиано, которые я встречал в различных местах (не имею Understanding the theory of piano behaviour will help you using Pianoteq. You may wonder why the sound becomes this and that, why the adjustment of a certain parameter does not result in what you expected. 
I suddenly got huge performance problems. The only thing I changed was that I updated Pianoteq VSTi from 6 to 6.4, but I don't think it was related to that. Before, I could get good real time ASIO performance with 96k sample rate and 256 block size. Now no matter how large block size I set, I still get crackles. Then I tried deleting all other tracks than the one I was using, and it started working perfectly, I can even turn block size to 128 and get great performance. But obviously I don't. A huge collection of Software Synthesizers software - freeware, shareware, and demos - that you can download for free. Platforms include Windows, Mac and Linux. What setup do you use to record yourself or others playing piano? amp#x200B; For acoustic performances I typically use my Zoom H6 recorder with a X/Y Mic. For digital, I have questions: I sometimes connect to the line in and record, but now I've been experimenting with virtual pianos like Pianoteq, Synthogy and Kontakt. They sound superb. But, how do you sync up the audio to the video correctly. VOLUME 1 - Now Available. With around 90 minutes of content, you'll have all you need to get up and running with Steinberg's 'Cubase Elements 8' in next to no time.'. Dear Music Theorists: I just got Pianoteq Standard (which is totally sweet), partially on the feature of alternate temperaments easily available in its GUI. Options include flat, equal, pythagorean, werckmeister. I understand that they are based on different philosophies regarding note-to-note ratios but I have a hard time hearing a difference between them. Can someone recommend an exercise or composition that would highlight the differences between temperaments. Cursosheredia.info is tracked by us since November, 2018.

For a long time ASIO4All worked just fine when recording electric bass through the line-in on my computer, then suddenly all audio sounds very low bitrate and horrible quality. I have messed with all settings that I can possibly think of or see within ASIO4All, but none of them change anything about the quality. Switching to another driver fixes it immediately, so I know it's ASIO4All causing the issue somehow, but I use the ASIO driver in other programs as well, and I need to figure out what's.

Hello friends, I currently have a Yamaha YPG235 I absolutely must upgrade from. The 76 unweighted plastic keys are killing my performance, especially after over 7 years of playing. It served well, but its time as come.I don't need anything crazy, couldn't care less about built in sounds or speakers because I always use Pianoteq and Addictive Keys as VSTis with my headphones plugged into my PC. I have a malleable budget; I want to spend no more than 0-600, but if I must I will, up to 00. サポート情報. 弊社取り扱い製品のアップデート情報、トラブルシュート、登録、ダウンロード方法などを解説する. Hey, Just wondering if anyone has tried Pianoteq with the Kawai MP11SE, and if so, is it worth it?

Hi there, On my MIDI keyboard the black keys are too sensitive (loud) compared to the white ones. I found a Windows program to supposedly work around this, allowing to adjust the velocity curve of individual keys: ( Is there any way to do this on Linux? I was thinking of something that globally modulates it, before it reaches the synthesizer program, since I use several different ones (Carla, qsample. reFX Nexus2 has a library tab which will let you have access to more than 762 factory presets which are divided into 16 different subcategories like Dance Leads, Piano, Epic Pads and Classical. Lifelong Windows user here, who recently switched over to Kubuntu 18.04 about four months ago. Since then, I have quite fallen in love with the Linux ecosystem as well as its overall community and ethos. All in all, have been satisfied with Kubuntu, so why fix what's not broken, right? Well, I looked at it as a great transitional stepping stone for migrating from Windows to Linux and it's been exactly that. However, I need to do a fresh install either way to merge the existing partitions

I've been playing piano for 4 years now. I have a Casio privia px 150 (my first digital piano), for the past year I have been using this as a midi controller to control pianoteq. This gives me good piano sound, at least better than the inbuilt sound from privia. Since pianoteq detects half damper, this is also taken care as of now. My question is, will I improve my technique by upgrading to Yamaha ydp 163? (I really love the better key action with tri-sensor) My privia. Can someone explain what the editable overtones in Pianoteq 6 pro are and why I would want that over the standard version which doesn't Soooooo, I now have neighbour issues, meaning that my son can play his own grand piano less, thanks to a visit from the local council. However, this has meant that I have tried Pianoteq, and I have to say that it's marvellous. We now have a Kawai MP11SE stage piano and Pianoteq Pro. This is an amazing combination and we are having a lot of fun. Every cloud has a silver lining. Here's a very early recording: https://youtu.be/S5vnHyLy-78. okay I am totally new to this Ive only ever played on acoustic pianos. My budget is 2000EUR. So as I understand it you have a software on your computer that produces the sound, for example pianoteq. Then you connect via USB or MIDI to control pianoteq. However in my research I have learned that some digital keyboards are better than others at sending MIDI. For example on pianoworld i have seen discussion where some say that their piano cannot produce notes below 30 velocity or above Have been building my PCs for the last 15+ years. Would like to replace my current dual-boot Windows/Ubuntu build (7700k, 32 GB, GTX 1080, etc.) with a Linux-only system that I will feel confident about for the next 3 or so years. Usually, I prefer to sell my existing build while it still retains a used value of 0-00 and put that money to the next one. Not the most prudent financial strategy, I know, but keeps me on the upswing of technology enough for my tastes - plus, I enjoy 
I want to preface this by saying that I'm a beginner, so go easy on me if this is obvious or low-level stuff. This last week I've hade the idea of constructing a 12-note scale using a circle (or spiral, I guess) of 11/8 "major fourths" instead of the regular circle of 3/2 perfect fifths. So last night I did the math and came up with this: (In cents) 0 65,52 161,88 259,24 356,6 453,96 551,32 713,2 810,56 907,92 1005,28 1102,64 1200 I used Pianoteq to try this tuning Pianoteq has four pedals on their pianos. I'm considering buying either the Pro or Studio version eventually. I'll probably wait until version. Hi, I have Addictive Keys and PianoTeq 6 on my computer. I can play the standalone programs fine, but I'm looking to feed my playing into a DAW to fix up my loose playing. :P Ideally I'd be playing amp hearing my VST, and it would be recording into the horizontal piano roll. I've finally got Pro Tools First up and running with a licence, but can't get either VST working. All information I've found is trying to get me to got a 'Marketplace' which presumably involves me paying more. (EDIT:. Both use triple sensors, and I'm going to use Keyscape/Pianoteq anyway. The Kawai is about twice as costly as the Roland. Does that even make sense. I tried out a Yamaha CP300 today I could buy second hand for €1500. Whether or not that's a good deal, the keybed certainly felt a lot better than my Kawai ES-110 and I would like to upgrade soon. But what strikes me about all the digital pianos I come in contact with is that they sound, very consistently, lifeless and dead inside. The CP300 is one of those models that comes with two okay-ish grand piano sounds and then a load of comical noises I personally have no interest in, and although. Apparently the piano I have now (Yamaha P-45) is crap when it comes to MIDI. I was never able to make even a half decent velocity curve for any of the VSTs I use with it. Initially I thought I was just stupid. Yesterday I googled around a bit and this actually seems to be a common issue ( 1 (https://www.forum-pianoteq.com/viewtopic.php?id=4527), 2 (https://forum.yamaha-europe.com/forum/allgemeine-diskussion/keyboards/46031-vst-instrumente-%C3%BCber-mein-p45-klingen-nicht-so-toll) Hey guys, so, I've had my Yamaha CLP 535 for some time now and while it's been great, the interior sample library has started to wear and become a little bland to me. I've done a lot of research and played a few demos of some standalone piano sample libraries such as Addictive Keys and Pianoteq and they sound great! I just have a question if anyone is using any of these programs with their digital piano, what kind of set up do you use? Do you use an audio interface for lower latency and better. So I wanted to start recording off of my piano using MIDI, so I got Reaper and started using the free trial for pianoteq. The audio sample for pianoteq sounded bad to me, so I moved on to the Addictive Keys free trial. I was so impressed with the sound that I jumped the gun and purchased it. After playing around with it, I noticed that I have a hard time letting the melody stand out because the most piano noise I can make is still relatively forte, and I'm not too sure if this is a hardware. Hey folks, I recently got a MIDI keyboard with a great action but terrible piano voices. My plan is to build in some miniature device which receives MIDI keyboard input and sends digital grand piano sounds to the keyboard's internal amplifier through an auxiliary audio input. Looking around for suggestions, someone recommended Pianoteq 6 which can run on an overclocked Raspberry Pi 3 B+ with active cooling. Can anyone give me any review or feedback or information on exactly how well Pianoteq. 
I've been looking to get back into playing piano after years of not playing. Currently, I'm not in the financial situation to be able to drop k on a piano but I would like to get as close to that experience as possible. Recently, I came across VST's and wondered how an fp-50 or a Kaway vpc1 connected to something like Pianoteq or Ivory fare against something like Yamaha's hybrid pianos or an actual acoustic. I do have a decent set of headphones (HD-600) and computer, so presume speaker quality. I’ve had the piano for 13 years now and it still works great, but obviously I’m looking to upgrade as its severely lacking in almost every area. The problem is, I will need to wait at least a few months before I can spend enough on a new piano, so I’m wondering if there are any bad habits I should watch out for, if it’s not already too late? Edit: I should also say I’m using it with Pianoteq so at least the sound is decent. Also using an M-Audio SP-2 metal pedal. </p>
