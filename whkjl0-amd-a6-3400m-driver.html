                            <p>I just replaced my laptop's screen (to no avail, won't light up). I am using a secondary monitor through HDMI. Ever since I replaced the screen the sound only works when it wants. It will start working for maybe 10 minutes when I take it out of sleep or turn it on, then won't play sound at all until I put it in sleep mode for 10 seconds. I noticed most of the time as long as sound is playing, the speakers will play sound. I I pause a YouTube video for example and re play it the sound won't. Hello! I'm running Windows 10 on my HP Pavilion g6, and recently (not sure exactly when) it will no longer shut down or restart. When I choose to shut down or restart it seems like Windows will shut down (screen goes black and all that) but the laptop itself is still running, and the power light stays on. I then have to do a hard shutdown by holding the power button to get it to turn off. I haven't had much luck in looking things up. Any ideas? I've recently updated a bunch of drivers using. Im getting BSOD when rebooting after windows installs GPU drivers, or i install HP 2011 drivers, And drivers fail to work properly after using AMD auto detect utillity on my old 2011 Laptop. I am launching Windows in SafeMode and deleting the failing GPU drivers with Device Manager. Uninstalling all AMD Ati software with Windows Programs and Features. And Manually deleting ALL AMD Ati Folders. BeFore Reinstalling. Ive replaced the failed MOBO in this laptop with an identical 
Hey all, i would need your help with drivers(at least i think it is drivers fault). I came back into game after year or two  but i had only 10 fps (I've never had a lot of FPS with my AMD HD 6520G, but most of time 30-40 FPS on ultra low settings). Since that time, I reinstalled my laptop and forgot to updated GPU drivers. So when I saw 10 FPS i went straight to AMD site and downloaded latest drivers. Now i have 30-40 FPS but there is small problem  i am able to see maybe 15% of all model. Hey dudes so I got an old laptop with an AMD A6-3400M APU with Radeon Graphics 1.40ghz. The two grpahics cards are AMD Radeon HD6520G and HD7400M series. I'm an absolute noob when it comes to this stuff so I don't even know which of these cards is the stronger one. The thing is that about 2 years ago I played a shit ton of Borderlands2 and it ran fine. I tried playing it again recently and it just barely ran. I think that maybe my graphics card drivers are out of date or maybe it's using I have an old pavilion dv6-6xxxx laptop with an amd A6-3400m APU with hd 6520g graphics. When I try to install the legacy driver in Windows 10 there are no options to install the display driver, just the hdmi audio driver. I've uninstalled the one provided by windows update with ddu in safemode. Was wondering if anyone else had any luck installing this driver in Windows 10 or if I'm doing something wrong. Hi, I'm new to OW and not very good with tech stuff either. I read a whole bunch of forum threads which tell me different things and there wasn't one with my specific system specs. My laptop is prettyyyy old and the vid card not that great either. Driver support already stopped a few years back too. Here's my laptop spec: Processor: AMD A6-3400M with Radeon HD Graphics (4 CPUs) 1.4GHz RAM: 6gb GPU: AMD Radeon HD 6520G Windows 10, 64-bit, DirextX 11.1 Is it possible to run OW on the lowest. Hi, I just got an old laptop from my Dad, I instantly installed Elementary OS on there. The only problem is that the laptop is an AMD laptop, so that means AMD APU. My APU is an A6-3400m and Radeon HD 6520G. Sadly both driver options Elementary gave me in driver updates had less to be desired performance, stuttering in 720p video, which didn't happen while booted into windows. My question is should I use the latest beta drivers for the open source driver or the latest beta proprietary. Specs: Processor: AMD Vision A6-3400M APU quad core with AMD Radeon HD Graphics OS: Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit RAM: 6gb Laptop is hooked to hdtv via hdmi, and wireless keyboard and mouse via usb dongle. I'm playing the newest Runescape edition on low settings, and quite often, the screen withh fuzz out, and the BSOD will show. I usually unplug the laptop as soon as I see BSOD. Edit: my graphics drivers were 5 years old according to Runescape, so I updated them. I'm wondering if that's. I was trying to update the drivers for my graphics card via control panel when all of a sudden my computer blue screened during the process. After this happened and my computer restarted, my Steam wouldn't launch properly. This is what would happen. 1. I click the Steam icon. It shows "Verifying installation" for about a second before disappearing. 2. The login screen would pop up. I'd put in my login info. 3. Steam tells me that it's "Connecting steam account: mdirt.," and then it'll  Hi, I'm on an ASUS K53TA laptop running an AMD A6-3400m CPU, 6520G GPU, 4GB RAM and a 750GB HDD running Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit. The problem most likely has nothing to do with that, but I thought I'd include it just in case. I recently plugged in an ethernet cable into my laptop in hopes that I would get faster and more stable internet connection for gaming. However, I keep getting "Unidentified Network" "No network access". This is really annoying me as I have tried everything including. 
Specs: Win 7 Home Premium AMD A6-3400M APU with Radeon HD Graphics 64-Bit Problem: When using ASUS PC Driver I install AMD UMA Driver Version 8.863.0.0000 After I install this my computer displays graphics properly. Can play games, watch video, etc. Approximately 3 - 8 hours after installing CMD opens up and runs uninstall.exe. The results of the uninstall I am incapable of seeing as it performs them incredibly fast then CMD closes. My graphics then starts to display incorrectly. Laptop specs: Aspire 5560g AMD A6-3400m Radeon HD 6540G2 (6520G and 6430M crossfired) 8GB DDR3 Windows 7 64bit This one has a bit of a story to it. I got it from a family member and originally it wouldn't go to POST, just lights on and drive spin up. I check the display with a light and connect to external display, no dice. Naturally I assume the gpu was screwed so I take the HDD out to recover data. I give it one final try without the HDD and to my surprise it shows Hello! I've done several searches for solutions to this problem and nothing seems to work (uninstalled all USB controllers in Device Manager, updated motherboard drivers, re-attached every USB device I have, physically opened laptop to ensure connections were ok, etc.). Does that just mean my computer's junk? My laptop keeps telling me that a USB device isn't recognized, and I have no idea why since nothing is plugged in. In Device Manager, an "unknown device" pops up (and sometimes immed. My computer had recently been glitching during videos (randomly, just for a brief second and the video and sound stop). Now it briefly stops when I download things from my browser and I have to wait a minute or two before things will move again. This has started affecting my gaming as when I play league of legends my computer takes a bit longer to load things and the FPS will randomly drop by about 40-50 frames.
